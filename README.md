# React tech test

## Tasks

Using a Javascript Framework of your choice (Preferably React) or regular native Javascript, please carry out the following tasks:

1. ~~Consume the good endpoint and display a list of the results on-screen.~~
2. ~~Display the results in capitals without using CSS transforms.~~
3. Add search functionality to the UI that uses the search endpoint instead.
4. Take the error endpoint and display the error message it returns.
5. If the search term called a second time then fetch it from a local JS cache rather than hitting the network.
